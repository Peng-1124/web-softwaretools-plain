## XP(ExtremeProgramming) or Scrum

### Extreme Programming

Extreme Programming (XP) was proposed by Kent Beck in 1996. Extreme programming is a lightweight and dexterous software development method; At the same time, it is also a very rigorous and careful method. XP is a near spiral development method, which decomposes the complex development process into relatively simple small cycles; Through active communication, feedback and a series of other methods, developers and customers can be very clear about the development progress, changes, problems to be solved and potential difficulties, and timely adjust the development process according to the actual situation.

### Scrum

Scrum is a framework for developing and maintaining complex products. It is an incremental and iterative development process. In this framework, the whole development process consists of several short iteration cycles. A short iteration cycle is called a sprint, and the recommended length of each sprint is 2 to 4 weeks. In scrum, product backlog is used to manage product requirements. Product backlog is a list of requirements sorted by business value. The list items are usually reflected in user stories. The scrum team always develops requirements that are of high value to customers first.

In sprint, the scrum team selects the highest priority requirements from the product backlog for development. The selected requirements are discussed, analyzed and estimated at the sprint planning meeting to obtain the corresponding task list, which we call sprint backlog. At the end of each iteration, the scrum team will deliver potential deliverable product increments. Scrum originated in software development projects, but it is suitable for any complex or innovative project.

The main factors of Scrum:

First, iterative development. In scrum's development mode, we divide the development cycle into multiple 1-4 week iterations, and each iteration delivers some incremental working functions. The length of the iteration is fixed. If we choose one week iteration, keep its length unchanged. Each iteration is one week in the whole product development cycle. What needs to be emphasized here is that each iteration must produce workable incremental functions, rather than the first iteration for requirements, the second iteration for design and the third iteration for code.

Second, incremental delivery. Increment is the sum of all product to-do list entries completed in one sprint and all previous sprints. At the end of sprint, the new increment must be "completed", which means that it must be available and meet the criteria defined by the scrum team for "completion". Whether or not the product owner decides to actually release it, the increment must be available. Increment is described from the user's point of view, which means that it can work from the user's point of view.

Third, self-organizing team. Scrum team is a self-organizing team. The traditional command and control team only has the right to perform tasks, while the self-organizing team has the right to design, plan and perform tasks. The self-organizing team also needs to supervise and manage their engineering process and progress. The self-organizing team decides how to work in the team and who will do what, That is, the way of division of labor and cooperation.

Fourth, high priority demand driven. In scrum, we use the product backlog to manage requirements. The product backlog is a list of requirements. The requirements in the product backlog are gradually detailed, and the items in the backlog must be sorted according to the business value. When developing requirements, the scrum team starts from the high priority requirements at the top of the backlog. In scrum, as long as there are enough refined high priority requirements developed by 1-2 sprint, we can start sprint without waiting until all requirements are refined. During development, we can sort out the backlog to gradually refine the requirements.

Summary: In order to implement our project well and we have compared the above two schemes. Moreover, and we have list the advantages and disadvantages of two schemes. We decided to work on Scrum. The reason is as below, the development module in Scrum can make us divide our develop task into many sprints, we can assign development work into each sprint. Then every sprint needs a user story to drive so that we can communicate with users all the time to obtain user needs. Moreover, Multiple iterations of the product can enable us to meet the needs of users all the time. Finally, the most important thing is that we need to accommodate to the rapidly changing requirements and we can develop our own code instead of pair programming which is EX needs.

## Tools used in Group work

### a.Teams

Teams meeting. Sometimes, we need to share our screen to discuss the design of our code format and UI design. In teams meeting, we can communicate with each other about the idea of think and upload files such as docx file, UI prototype and UI design. And we choose desk17 in grp-MSc Software Engineering to have our meetings. Therefore, we choose teams to hold our sprint review meeting.
<img src="https://github.com/Peng-1124/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/Figures/process/teamsmanagement.gif" />

### b. Wechat meeting

If we have to just communicate our moment's thought. As you know, we could bring up an idea in a flash, even when we are eating. So that we can share our idea with others immediately. The most important reason is that Wechat is the most popular smartphone messaging app in China and four of us has the same mother tongue. We do three main task by wechat.

a. Daily communication

b. Daily Scrum Meeting

c. Task brief

### c. Miro 

A graphical interface machine rich software which can make us exchange your ideas freely on it. Moreover, we can add our own idea about features and design on it. We can also see other people's idea. At the design stage of our programming, it helps us a lot. We have discussed about the framework of front-end and draw a overall architecture diagram on it. In general, this is a stage for our team to brainstorm. All four team members can post their views on the whole project. Because the team members are in different regions, we usually have the problem of time difference. This software solves this problem well, because if any team member puts forward his own ideas on it, other members can see it during their working hours.

### d. Monday

Founded in Tel Aviv, Israel in 2012, monday.com is a tool integrating communication, planning and management of the whole team. It has the functions of creating and assigning tasks, planning workload, commenting, notifying team members, sharing files, and visualizing the current work of members. 

We use this software to manage our team. As we all known, during one sprint, we need a product backlog and sprint backlog, the former refers to the product to-do list. The product owner quantifies the needs of users and lists the actual needs to be developed one by one. The latter refers to the task list, which is the list of tasks to be completed in an iteration, mainly the detailed work of the development team.

For each function development, designers and developers need to estimate their completion time and give the relevant schedule - which is only an estimate. After the first "sprint" is completed, you will be more aware of the time required for the next "iteration".

Generally speaking, in addition to project requirements, the iteration requirements list also displays status, such as "before iteration", "under review", "project blocked", etc. These cards are posted on the Kanban wall to "visualize" the progress of all functional development.

So we follow the kanban process by this tool. We divided our project into three main items, "working" item, "done" item and "stack" item.
<img src="https://github.com/Peng-1124/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/Figures/process/kanban1.gif">

During each sprint, we still have our sprint backlog to quantify the tasks in each sprint.

![image](https://github.com/Peng-1124/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/Figures/process/kanban.png)

We also use the "Maintable" function to visualize our work status. It can intuitively reflect everyone's daily work tasks and work status, as well as whether the tasks have been completed and so on.

# Team Roles

## Analyze contributions using tables

At first, we decided to focus on Scrum.  We have three roles of Scrum, product owner, Scrum master and Scrum team members.

## RACI

RACI is a relatively intuitive model to clarify the roles and related responsibilities in the process of organizational change. We know that the process of change cannot be spontaneous or automatic, and someone must act on it to make the process change. Therefore, it is necessary to define and describe who does what and what kind of change is promoted. We use it to display our work.

As we know, we used "Miro" and "Monday" to manage our team more efficiently. Before we get familiar with Monday and Miro.  We also use RACI to give a more intuitive performance of everyone's task

Who is responsible (R = responsible), that is, the role responsible for performing tasks. He / she is specifically responsible for controlling the project and solving problems.

·Who approves (A = accountable), that is, the role of taking full responsibility for the task. The project can be carried out only after he / she agrees or signs.

·Who is consulted (C = consulted) and who has the information or ability to complete the project.

·Who is notified (I = informed), i.e. the person who has the privilege and should be notified of the results in time, but does not have to consult and solicit opinions from him / her.

### sprint brief

The development of the project is divided into three sprints, each sprint has their user stories which drive the development. Each sprint last almost week.  During each sprint, we strictly follow all scrum development rules. We will have user stories, that is, user needs to drive our development. We divided each story into several tasks. We asked the team members to complete a task within 8 hours, and each task should not exceed one working day. In each sprint, we will make a sprint backlog. Before the start of each sprint, the team leader will formulate a spring plan meeting. The sprint plan meeting is for everyone to sit down and introduce the ordered product backlog to everyone, and then everyone will think and decide how to promote the plan and sort out the sprint backlog to complete the follow-up work. Estimate and arrange the workload in the sprint planning meeting, determine the demand, submit it to R & D, and enter the story kanban(Monday.com). We use Monday to manage our story Kanban(Monday.com) every time. During each sprint, we will hold a daily stand through wechat. At the daily station meeting, everyone must report what they completed yesterday, what they plan to complete today, and whether they have difficulties and need the assistance of team members. At the end of each day's meeting, team members need to go to Monday to update their personal Kanban(Monday.com) today.

When a sprint is completed, the most important demonstration meeting, also known as the review meeting, will be held in Teams. Product leaders and customers will participate. Members of the development team will demonstrate their completed software products, and then be judged whether the products are qualified, successful, need to be modified or redone. Finally, the group held a sprint summary meeting. The summary meeting was held by taking turns. Everyone had to speak, summarize and discuss the improvements, and put them into the product requirements of the next round of sprint.

The graph has shown how we use use stories to drive each feature on our website. And about each user story, how do we split each user story and use the user story to analyze the requirements. Break down each user story into various requirements for development.



## Time line

We planed to have three sprint. The first sprint last five days. The second lasts seven days. And the third lasts 6 days. Each sprint has clear use stories and have been divided into several tasks.

## Detail of sprint 

### The first sprint

we plan to begin our first sprint on July 30th. This sprint will last 4 days. In this sprint, our plan and activity are as follows

#### User story

As a user(the user is the owner of this website), I want the add or delete the pets or add tag on the website, so that I want my website will be more flexible and pets lover can view more information about a pet through tag.

 As a user , I want to filter pets through something so that I can find the pets which I like directly.

| User story title         | User story description                                       | scene                   | want                                                  | action                                 | priority  |

| filter the pets          | As a user , I want to filter pets through something so that I can find the pets which I like directly. | when search a pet       | want to search a kind of pets have the same attribute | filter                                 | very high |

#### Sprint Target

In this sprint,  we analyze the user stories and decide what we plan to add features below to our website

| Feature           | Description of features                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add pets          | this function allow users to add pets to website           |
| delete pets       | this function allow users to delete pets on sale           |
| add tag to a pets | this function allow users to add more tags to a pet        |
| Filter pets       | this function allow users to filter the pets by pets' tags |

#### Sprint team division

Product owner: Peng Gao

Scrum master: Weibang

Scrum team: Peng Gao, Weibang, HaoFu, Richard Zhang

Peng Gao:  Test the APIs will be used in this sprint and join in the development of four features.

Weibang: Arrange meetings and organize daily standing meetings, and record standing meetings. After the development is completed, the user experience is obtained by letting the user experience first.

Hao Fu: Telp Peng to develop add pets and add tags function.

Richard: Telp Peng to develop delete pets function and filter function.

#### Sprint work

The first thing in this sprint we do is to complete a basic frond-end frame so that we can put combine our new features with it and develop our new features more efficiently. Then we get that user story from the user interview we have done before and analysis the user stories. Then we cut user stories into many tasks. At the first task, we testing the API which control adding pets to our website and then compile our code. The library we requested is Axios, and the requested API is provided by petstore.swagger.io. At the pets adding page, we require users to input the information of the pet and we post '/pet' API to add a new pet to our store. Secondly, we decide to use a delete button which can make users to delete the pets. Then, the add tag function is also be added to our website which also use API provided by petstore.swagger.io. In addition, about the filter function, we decide to receive a use input at page which may be a tag of animal and a filtering button. If user click it with a user input, our program will filter the tag and show the pets which has tag matches user input. Finally, after all the features in this sprint have been finished, we invite the users to test this features and give each of them a mark. Then in sprint review meeting, we will discuss how can we improve the features and whether these features are qualified. 

#### Sprint meeting log

During this sprint, we hold a meeting at beginning to discuss our main user stories and cut them in to four tasks. Each task will last one day. Hao was absent for covid antibody test. At the meeting, we discussed the feasibility of several features and the uncertainty of the API provided. Because in the test phase, we found that the data returned by several APIs was unstable. Some data will change after the page is refreshed. We also discussed the design of adding pages, whether we need pop-up windows or new pages. In addition, we discussed the filtering function. In order to allow users to filter out pets they are not interested in, we decided to filter pet tags to achieve this function. After the first meeting, we will hold a daily station meeting through wechat every day in this sprint. Team members report their work, problems encountered, and functions to be developed the next day at the daily station meeting. Finally, after all the functions in this sprint have been developed and tested, we have held sprint review meeting invite users to try these functions and then improve according to user feedback. Notes: After a task is over, our team member will update the Burn Down Chart and the personal kanban. 

And the most important thing is that our team members and users have found that every time we get PET data, there will be a lot of duplicate data. After discussion, we feel that we need to process every request to get data. Do an array de duplication for the data. Through ID filtering, the ID of each pet is consistent.

### The second sprint

We begin our second sprint at August 3rd. This sprint will last almost seven days. In this sprint, our plan and activity are as below

#### user story

As a user, I want to search for pets according to my preferences so that the search functions of this pets should be all-round and excellent.

As a user, I want to the pets on this website have a order so that I can browse this website more directly.

As a user(the user is the owner of this website), I want to have different permissions with buyers.

#### Sprint targets

We have analyze the user story. In addition to a series of functions designed for user stories.

| Features                    | description of features                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| search function             | Users can search pets by ID                                  |
|                             | Users can search pets by name                                |
|                             | Users can do fuzzy pets. For example, if the user searches for dog, all pets with dog in their name will be displayed |
| order function              | User can arrange the displayed pets in ascending or descending order according to their IDs |
| login registration function | In order to make administrator has different permissions with users, we design a login registration function that the administration has permissions to add, delete pets and add tag to pet but users do not. |

#### Sprint team division

Product owner: Peng Gao

Scrum master: Weibang

Scrum team: Peng Gao, Weibang, HaoFu, Richard Zhang

Peng Gao:  Test the APIs will be used in this sprint and join in the development of searching, ordering and login registration function.

Weibang: Arrange meetings and organize daily standing meetings, and record standing meetings. After the development is completed, the user experience is obtained by letting the user experience first.

Hao Fu: Telp Peng to develop searching function and order function

Richard: Telp Peng to develop delete searching function and login registration function.

#### Sprint work

We also worked on the frame we have finished in the first sprint. The tasks of this sprint are very import so we spend almost seven days on it. The task of our sprint this time is relatively heavy. The search function has a wide range, so we designed the above search function according to user interviews. In this sprint, in order to make the search function work normally. We need to filter the pet information according to tag, category and name to get what we want. Through ID search, we need to compare the obtained data with the ID entered by the user. If it is the same, we will show the user what the user needs. By searching by name, we also compare the obtained PET data with the user's input, so that we can show the user what the user wants. The last search function is fuzzy search. Instead of using regular expressions, we use the index method in JavaScript. Because after evaluation, we think such search results are more accurate. Then there is the sorting function. This function is also the function we think we can do by obtaining user stories through user interviews and segmenting user stories. Finally, we do a sorting function in ascending and descending order according to ID. Finally, the user login registration system we have done. We have made a user login and registration page and set up an administrator account. Give administrators and buyers different permissions. The account of the manager is "admin". Compared with the user, the manager has several special permissions. The manager can add and delete pets and add pet tags. And these permissions, as buyers, do not. 

We solved the problem raised last time, that is, ID de duplication. We filter the ID so that the ID of each pet displayed on the page is different.

#### Sprint meeting log

All the team members attend the beginning meeting. In this sprint, we still hold daily standing meetings through wechat. Because the workload of this sprint is very heavy, we need to report and summarize our work every day. In the spring review meeting, we still evaluated and tested the functions developed in this sprint, invited users to experience and obtained user feedback. This user experience test was very helpful to us and found problems that we didn't find in the sprint review. Because the development team is very familiar with the website, but users do not, we need to set up function reminder notes to remind users of the functions of each component. And the most important thing is that according to user feedback, our web page can't be reset after each search (unless the web page is refreshed). We will analyze and solve this problem in the next sprint.

### The third sprint

we begin our third sprint on August 10th and this sprint lasts almost five days.

#### user story

As a user, I want to view a very excellent web page. The layout and each page of this website will be very friendly to us.

#### sprint targets

During this sprint, what we do is we do the UX/UI design. And after the UI designing, we use vue and element UI to complete our front-end. Moreover, we also need to combine the functions we have developed before with our front-end.

#### Sprint team division

Product owner: Peng Gao

Scrum master: Weibang

Scrum team: Peng Gao, Weibang, HaoFu, Richard Zhang

Peng Gao:  Combine the functions we have developed before with our front-end.

Weibang: Arrange meetings and organize daily standing meetings, and record standing meetings. After the development is completed, the user experience is obtained by letting the user experience first. Design the UI, and then use vue and element UI to complete them. Finish the final front-end developmeng.

Hao Fu: Telp Peng to combine the new features with the front-end.

Richard: Telp Peng to combine the new features with the front-end.

#### Sprint work

Our main work in this sprint is to use vue.js and element UI to complete our front end. And combine the functions developed by our previous two sprints with the front end. Our team members of this sprint mainly designe and compile all the pages of the website. It also sets the layout of each function on the page and selects many icons that can prompt users for website functions. We have mainly completed the design and completion of three interfaces. After each completion, we will conduct user research and complete iterations. Our three interfaces are: main interface, add pet interface and login registration interface. The functions of searching, sorting, deleting pets and adding labels to pets are all placed on the main interface. The rest of the pet functions are added on the add interface. Finally, the login registration function is placed on the login registration interface. Then we test all the features of this website and do the HCI evaluation.

Notes: we also solved the problem of page reset proposed in the last sprint. We added a reset function. After each user search, users can jump back to the original page through the reset function, that is, a status reset function.

#### Sprint meeting log

All the team members attend the spring beginning meeting. In this sprint, we organized the daily station meeting through wechat as usual. In the final sprint review meeting, we not only evaluated all the development objectives of this sprint, but also evaluated the testing of the overall project.

## Highlights & Critical Points

In our opinion, there are two highlights and key points of our project. The first highlight and key point occurred in the second sprint, because when we designed to add pets, delete pets, add pet tags and filter functions in the first sprint, we did not find that there was a lot of redundancy in the data we requested. I mean, every time we get and display PET data on the page, a lot of it is repeated. So we de duplicated the data. We removed the pets with the same ID by comparing the IDs of each group of data. Finally, we show all the processed data on the page. As you can see, each pet have identical ID.

Then another highlight also occurs in sprint2, in this sprint. We deal with the administrator and user permissions according to the needs of users. It gives two users different rights. Weibang first discovered this problem in this sprint and told the development team. We set up the administrator user through a flag, and gave the administrator user the function of operating pets. This seems to us to be a great success.

If you are a administrator,the interface is as below. Administrator has more functions to use than other uses(Notes: Marked in red circle)

If you are a users who wants to bu pets through our website, the interface is as below:

# Continuous Integration

## Use of git and how GitHub supported us in streamlining our workflows throughout the project

To ensure our streamlining work flows, we have done the following work.

Firstly, Peng is responsible for manage the git repository. Firstly we have five main branches during our development, which are main, develop, data, pm and test. Peng is responsible for manage the main, develop and test branches which are related to development directly. Weibang is responsible for manage the pm branch which is related to our UI design. Hao and Richard are responsible for manage data branch which related to user researches and so no. The things in the main branch make us finally show it to the review teacher. Our other branches are separated from the main branch and will eventually be merged into the main branch.

main: The final project after development.

develop branch: Code, the font-end code.

data branch: The meeting record, spring record, user interview, user questionnaire and other data related to users

pm branch: The UI prototype design, design drawings of each interface, logo design drawings, button design drawings, interactive prototype design drawings, etc.

test branch: After each development finished, the new feature will be test here. And we also compile some test case here.

In order to avoid conflicts, we can emphasize the following at the first organizational meeting. Each team member has not only his own branch, but also his own folder. If team member a wants to submit documents in the folder in charge of B, it needs the consent of B. In this way, although the team members are doing their own work in different branches, they will not touch other people's folders without permission. In this way, we can effectively avoid conflict. At the end of each sprint, Peng will summarize everyone's work and merge other branches into the main branch.

In this case, each team member has its own branch and folder. Each update can be submitted for modification in its own folder on its own branch. In this way, we can effectively avoid conflict. In addition, in order to make the merging of GIT branches clearer, we also use Sourcetree, a portable git management software. This visualization software can more intuitively display the merge and commit information between our branches.

## Code sharing and parallel development

About how to sharing code and do parallel development, we also have our special management way. Our main development are in develop branch. During development period, all team members can get the permission from Peng to fetch and pull code from this branch. 

At the beginning of each day's work, team members will pull the previously developed and tested code from the code folder. Then develop according to the tasks on their respective kanban. During the opening process, we will exchange ideas and functions by wechat or Teams . When the day's development is completed, the person in charge of this sprint is responsible for summarizing and integrating everyone's work of the day, and pushing the code completed on the day to the development branch. The next day, we will pull the code uploaded by the person in charge from GitHub again for development, and then...

If we find that the team members violate the rules and cause conflicts, we will immediately hold a wechat meeting to discuss and solve the conflicts. If there is an unresolved conflict, Gao Peng will roll back the version. However, when the team members strictly abide by the GIT development rules of this group, there is no conflict that cannot be handled.

## How we do test driven development and how we do continuous integration 

As mentioned above, our highest level branch is the main branch, and all our development is in sub branches other than the main branch. In order to ensure the continuous integration and deployment of our code, we will design how to test the function when designing the function. Because the test methods of each function are different, we will test after the development of each function. And we will discuss the test results through the daily site meeting. After all members complete the development tasks of the day, we will push the code to GitHub to complete continuous integration.

For test driven development. We take testing as the center of the development process. Every time we develop, we will write test cases or design test schemes in advance. In the development process, the team members adhere to the development concept of making all development pass the test. As for testing, we will test the feasibility of the function before and after code refactoring. The things we tested include the feasibility of function and the feasibility of internal logic jump. Because some tests are not convenient for automated testing with test cases, we will test the data returned by the system after the function is executed. Our code refactoring is a software system change process that improves its internal behavior without changing the external behavior of the code, so that the code is loosely coupled (less dependent on external code) and cohesive (only one function is completed internally).
