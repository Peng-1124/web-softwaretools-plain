# UX Development
### Webpage design framework

This product is a website for showing pet, then it needs a good looking display listing. As this site is a single page application then the functionality should be implemented via buttons on top of the navigation bar. All the functionality to be implemented should be based on the Swagger API.

There are several advantages to using a button to implement some functionality rather than a text box. Firstly, as a 'component', a button is more integral and secondly, a button is more visible than a text box, making it easier to attract the user's attention.

Moreover, it is good to leave a good area of blank space on either side of the display listing so as to reduce the user's visual fatigue.
### Paper prototype

### Prototype of the first version

Click **[here](https://g7qb8e.axshare.com)** for a preview of the first version of the prototype.

We used Axure to draw a prototype of the first version of our web page. According to the design principles, we started with a low-fidelity prototype, i.e. a prototype that has only completed the functional design for the time being and has not yet been coloured and made interactive. This prototype that does not yet support jumping between pages in this version, showing only the layout design and some details of the main pages. This prototype was shared using AxShare for Axure. 

The following are screenshots of our initial version of the prototype.

![prop1-list](https://github.com/Peng-1124/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/Figures/uiux/prop1-list.png)

As can be seen here, the functions we have added, based on the list of functions and the structure diagram, are:

* Top navigation bar

  ![prop1-topbar](https://github.com/Peng-1124/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/Figures/uiux/prop1-topbar.png)

  * Serach a pet or pets by ID.
  * Filter pets by tag.
  * Pet list sorting (ascending, descending).

* Side navigation bar

  ![prop1-sidebar](https://github.com/Peng-1124/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/Figures/uiux/prop1-sidebar.png)

  * Go back to main page (showing list).
  * Pet store.
  * User information.

* Pet's showing card

  ![prop1-card](https://github.com/Peng-1124/web-softwaretools-plain/blob/main/Figures/uiux/prop1-card.png)

  * Show the image of the pet.
  * Delete a pet.
  * Add new tag for pet.

* To accommodate the massive increase in mobile users in this day and age, we are also planning to use a responsive layout, which will allow the page to be used well against a range of different screen sizes for display. In simple terms this allows you to make your web pages look good on a variety of devices. This is important in the multi-screen era and has a positive effect. [3]
* Don't show drop-down menus on the page, and some modules that are hidden by default, but show them by clicking a button or mousing over an area.
* Pet's showing cards will enlarge on mouseover to attract the user's attention.
* The list displays a GIF while loading and lowers the brightness of the screen to indicate that the user is loading.
* A pop-up prompt is required when the list is loaded.
* A second confirmation of the user is required when doing add and delete operations, by means of a pop-up warning.
