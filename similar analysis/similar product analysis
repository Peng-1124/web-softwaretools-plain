## Competitive and similar product analysis

We first analyze the main pet purchase channels in the UK and China. Study the advantages and disadvantages of features and user experience to provide experience and establish direction for our development.

Pets4Home[2]:

Pets4Home is one of the most popular pet classification information website in the UK. It can be used for pet lovers to sell pets and adopt pets. Tons of dogs, cats and other pets are shown on this website. This website has multiple features and the functional structures at all levels work together, the features of the whole website are perfect, and the design of the website is quite humanized.

Analysis: 

1. The search features of this website are very perfect. It provides category search, popular search and history search which can be used for reference and be applied to our project. Besides, users can do fuzzy search, that is, they can search for commodities according to some properties of commodities

2. Pets4Home also provides pet detail functions which can show the full details to users who are searching the pets. These features can also be used for reference to our project.
3. Menu functions. Sometimes, the menu is equivalent to a navigation bar for people to quickly jump through various pages.



Freeads [3]:

After exploring this website, the functional structure diagram we have drawn is as belwo:

Analysis:

1. The functions of this website are perfect and cover a variety of features for buyers and sellers. Especially its menu, on the menu, the users will see the features the website provides directly. Therefore, this website gives people a particularly intuitive feeling so that users can know its features and functions very well.
2. Although the menu bar of this website gives people a particularly intuitive feeling, in terms of page design, this menu bar is particularly complex for users. The information provided by the website is also complex, and users can not intuitively obtain various functions and information of the website. Therefore, this design should be avoided in the page design of our own website.
3. The search functions of this website are very perfect so that it can recommend some pets which users like. And users can do fuzzy search, that is, they can search for commodities according to some properties of commodities

Taobao[4]:

Taobao is the e-commerce software with the largest trading volume and the largest number of downloads in China. Many Chinese people choose Taobao platform when buying qualified pets online.

After exploring the all features of Taobao, we have drawn a functional structure diagram. The diagram is as below:

Analysis:

1. Compared with the functions of the first two websites, Taobao is the most comprehensive. It not only has a friendly user login interface, but also uses a lot of algorithms in the website. For example: collaborative recommendation filtering algorithm. Because of this algorithm, users will be more convenient when using the website. Especially when users are using search algorithms, the website will recommend products according to users' preferences, and will shield some products that users are not interested in.
2. Advertising pop ups often appear, which will affect the user experience
3. Taobao has the filter functions which can make users filter products by products' tags. Certain product has the tags. For example, if you want to buy computer on website, you can filter the computers by the CPU, graphics card or other components.

Summary of competitive and similar website analysis: from the above analysis, it can be seen that the mature websites are very perfect in the search function. Most of them use the collaborative recommendation algorithm to infer the products that users may be interested in through the user's browsing records. And these websites have their own independent user and administrator systems. In this way, the permissions of users and administrators can be distinguished, so that administrators and users have different permissions.

After all. We have summarized the results of user questionnaires and user interviews. According to user questionnaires, we have found that. For both buyers and sellers, they all want to have a feature that they can check the pets' status, create account, have their own account, place a order etc. But for sellers(the owner of this website), they'd love to have some permissions which users do not have. Such as uploading the photo of a pet, adding pets, deleting pets, add tags to a pet or delete tags of a pets and so on. According to user interview, this time, most of our users are interested in buying pets, and some are product managers (we want them to play the role of website owner because they are very professional in product design). For users, most of the functions they propose are about search. So about all,  we have summarized that, for users, they want to search by pets by ID, name or filter the pets by pets' tag, even fuzzy search. The results of Competitive and similar product analysis are the almost same as user interview and user quesitonnaire.

 The summary of possible features(according to user interview, user questionnaire and analysis of similar product):

For buyer:

a. check the status of pets

b. have their own account. In other word, hope the website have login/registration system

c. can place an order 

d. can find a pet by ID

e. can find pet by the pet's name

f. can filter the pet by pet's tag

d. do fuzzy search 

e. hope website can recommend the pets for buyers according to their preference

f. users can sort the pets ascending or descending order.

g. user Comments

h. related Items(explain Seeing  phrases like "You might like this" may make people feel the urge to click on given links. This includes two parts of features, collecting user data and analyzing it. The website can collect user data through appropriate means[5], analyze it through machine learning technology, and infer other products that users may like and recommend these products to them. This is good for selling more products.)

i. Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ). Some user questions may be very common. Instead of answering them for a single user every time, writing a FAQ section may be a better choice. This saves a lot of time for salespeople and helps them focus on the things that are more needed. 

j. If the FAQ section does not solve the userâ€™s question, they will still hope for the answer. If they can't get a response in time, their shopping enthusiasm may fade, or they may look for other businesses. This is undoubtedly very bad. This makes online customer service better than email. In order to realize this demand, we can add the live chat feature to our website.



For seller(the administrator of this website)

a. they want to have permissions to use all the features the users have and the other permissions the user do not have. Adding a pet

b. delete a pet

c. add tag of a pet

d. delete tag of a pet

e. upload the images of a pets

f. delete the order placed by buyers
