| Before the interview, we thanked the  interviewees for taking time out of their busy schedule to accept our  interview. The purpose of our interview is to get features from potential  users that can be added to our project. The interview lasted about 15  minutes. Here are the records:     <br />Q: Do you usually use pet websites?  <br />A: Yes. But I don’t browse pet sites  frequently. Because I do not have a pet yet, but I am very eager to have a  pet of my own. So, sometimes I go to some websites to browse pet prices and  information. I want to raise a corgi or husky hahaha, I often go back and  search for these two.  <br />Q: Under what circumstances do you  usually use pet websites?  <br />A: Every time I want to keep a pet very  much. That is, sometimes I am lonely because I live outside. So when I'm  bored with my mobile phone at night, I will go to see pets.  <br />Q: When was the last time you used a pet  website?  <br />A: Maybe two or three days ago. I searched  Corgi on my pet site. Sometimes I also go to some video sites to watch videos  of pets eating. I don’t know if it counts.  <br />Q: Please tell me about your latest  experience using a pet website.  <br />A: The last time I used it was not a pet  website either. It is Taobao. It can be regarded as a shopping website. I  searched the price of Corgi on this website. However, the price of each store  is different. This annoys me. Moreover, some shops even use the same photo,  but have different prices. This confuses me a bit.  <br />Q: Let me show you the pets4homes  website. Do you think this website is easy or difficult to use?  <br />A: I think it's quite simple. The  information is simple.  <br />Q: Do you like the design style of this  website?  <br />A: I prefer this simple style. I think it  looks pretty. Mainly the function is easy to find. I want to do everything on  this website quickly.  <br />Q: Do you think it is better for the  website's music to be brighter or dull? For example, a website with yellow or  red as the main melody and a website with black or gray as the main melody,  which one do you prefer?  A: I prefer grey and black websites. But  I don't find it dull. The current trend is not this kind of high cold wind.  But it is not dull at all. It's just that I prefer it.     <br /><br />Summary: This user thinks the simple  style is better. He browses pet websites when he is alone. Based on his  answer, I infer that his browsing frequency is not high. |                                                      |
