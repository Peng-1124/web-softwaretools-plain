| Before the interview, we thanked the  interviewees for taking time out of their busy schedule to accept our  interview. The purpose of our interview is to get features from potential  users that can be added to our project. The interview lasted about 10  minutes. Here are the records:     <br />Q: Hello. I’m very glad that you can  accept my interview. Do you keep pets at home?   <br />A: No. I hope I can keep a pet someday  though.   <br />Q: Good. What features do you expect from  our website? As a seller or a buyer.   <br />A: Yeah I have read your questionnaire  given to me. I think all features it mentioned are good and necessary.   Q: Thanks for your compliment. I guess  you have more to say as you accepted the interview?   <br />A: Yeah. I want to confirm something.   <br />Q: Like?     <br />A: First, I hope to be able to use your  website on my mobile phone. Mobile phones are very important terminals,  right?   <br />Q: Yeah. Someone mentioned this before. I  can tell you it will be a feature.   <br />A: Cool. Second, the privacy. I noticed that  you have an account system and order management system, which means will  record users’ personal information. I hope your app can keep the secret.  <br />Q: You can delete you account if you  don’t want to use our app anymore.   <br />A: Good. But I think that’s not enough. Can  you encrypt users’ personal data?   <br />Q: Well I think it’s a part of the infrastructure  for the server to defend data from attacking, not a part of our application.  But yeah, we will record your advice.   <br />A: OK. I don’t have other things to say.  Your app looks good. UI, logo, etc.   <br />Q: Thank you for your help. That’s all.      <br /><br />Summary:   Chenxing is one of our potential users,  too. This interview on 3rd August verified our previous interview results.  Users are mainly concerned about the core functions of the website, but also  about things such as mobile applications and privacy. We can now confirm that  the UI design is generally correct. |                                                         |
