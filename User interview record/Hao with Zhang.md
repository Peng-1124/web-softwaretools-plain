| Content of interview items: What other  features do you think can be added to our website based on the basic  framework |                                                         |
| Before the interview, we thanked the  interviewees for taking time out of their busy schedule to accept our interview.  The purpose of our interview is to get features from potential users that can  be added to our project. The interview lasted about 15 minutes. Here are the  records:     <br />Q: If you build a pet sales website, what  do you think is the most basic function?  <br />A: Login/register/release information/pet  list/pet details/my, these are the basic functions, this kind of payment can  go offline. For online payment, there must be an order/payment concept, and  the functions mainly include /price module (platform rake)/order list/order  details (cancel order, confirm receipt)/logistics progress.  <br />Q: Is this based on the user level?  <br />A: Yes, this is a user-level thing.  <br />Q: What else?  <br />A: Database design/user table/pet  table/payment, these should be enough.  <br />Q: Have you visited other pet sales  websites?  <br />A: I have seen some. However,  domestically, it is mainly based on offline purchases. More websites provide  their store addresses, it is recommended that you go to the store to learn  about the actual product before buying. Because more people do not choose to  trust online channels, they feel that many pets purchased online will have  some diseases themselves, similar to canine distemper. Therefore, if the  safety of pets can be guaranteed, this is a very feasible project.  <br />Q: For those online purchasing functions,  are the current functions sufficient for you?  <br />A: If you simply purchase, as long as you  include the pet list, purchase function, and order function, I think it will  be enough.  <br />Q: Which functions do you often use?？  <br />A: Mainly search and item list. Because I  will spend a lot of time to choose. After all, buying is a fast process.  Q: What do you think these functions need  to be improved?  <br />A: The page design of some websites is  too complicated. I don't think the comfort level is enough. In fact, the more  concise the page is, the appointment should be made. Just provide a list of  pets so that I can compare them.     <br /><br />Summary: Log in to register, release  information, pet list, order list are the most important function. |                                                         |
