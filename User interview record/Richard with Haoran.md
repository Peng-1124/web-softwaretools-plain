| Before the interview, we thanked the  interviewees for taking time out of their busy schedule to accept our  interview. The purpose of our interview is to get features from potential  users that can be added to our project. The interview lasted about 10  minutes. Here are the records:     <br />Q: Hello. I’m very glad that you can  accept my interview. Do you keep pets at home?   <br />A: I used to keep a pet in my parents’  home. I’d like to keep one in my home now.   <br />Q: Good. What features do you expect from  our website? As a seller or a buyer.   <br />A: Well as a potential buyer I think a  simple web app is enough. I don’t like a too complex UI. I don’t have any experience  as a pet seller, but I guess they will have a similar idea that the web app  should be lite and easy to use.   <br />Q: So just basic functions? Show and view  information, sell and buy?   <br />A: Yeah. I don’t think we need more fancy  features. Just let me buy a cat or something.   <br />Q: What do you think about an account  system?   <br />A: Better not. I don’t want to keep an  account of a rarely used website.   <br />Q: But the account system might be  necessary for a website to sell pets? Order management is also a necessary  function. Probably you will want to cancel your order or something.   <br />A: Yeah…Maybe I can accept an account  system now. But I need to cancel it when I don’t use this app anymore.   <br />Q: Good. Why you choose our website? I  mean, what features do you care most when you are choosing a pet website?  <br />A: Well, I think I just want to buy a  pet. It may be irrelevant to this topic, UX designation, but your team should  really have some good resources. Oh, maybe some services related to pets.   <br />Q: Well we just want to design a pet shop  website now.   <br />A: If you add more services, the website  won’t become disposable. So the account system will be more acceptable and useful.  I think that’s a good idea.  <br />Q: Good idea. That’s all. Thank you for  your help.     <br /><br />Summary:   I think Haoran Gao is a typical customer  we will meet. He just cares about whether he can buy the pet he wants on the  website. Our UX design should undoubtedly revolve around this direction. He  also gave us some useful suggestions for our application, but it may not be  in the plan of this project. |                                                         |
