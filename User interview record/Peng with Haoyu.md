Good suggestion. And what  features do think we should add in towards the search bar?  <br />A: In my view, I think the most important  function you should implement is that the user can search pets in search bar,  such as using pets’ name or pets’ tag.  <br />Q: Ok, That’s fine. And what else? because our website feature is very basic,  what we should do is to add some basic features.  <br />A:emm, I think you should add a feature  that your users can filter the pets using the pets ID or order the pets using  some thing  <br />Q: yeah, yeah. That is fine! Thanks for  your suggestion. And thanks for your joining |                                                         |
