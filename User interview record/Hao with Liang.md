| Before the interview, we thanked the  interviewees for taking time out of their busy schedule to accept our  interview. The purpose of our interview is to get features from potential  users that can be added to our project. The interview lasted about 15  minutes. Here are the records:     <br />Q: What do you think you will do if you  use pet sites?  <br />A: Choose the pet you like.  <br />Q: Do you prefer to browse pet websites  on mobile or computer?  <br />A: On the computer side. This may be  because of my work. I sit in front of the computer most of the time, so I  think the computer is more convenient. Moreover, I am currently trying to  reduce the time I use my mobile phone. Although I will still do things on the  computer that I should have done with my mobile phone, I will still be happy  because I have reduced my mobile browsing time.  <br />Q: How often do you visit pet websites? <br />A: I often browse. About three or four  times a week.  <br />Q: What are you most concerned about when  buying pets? Price, variety or location?  <br />A: I tend to look at it from multiple  dimensions. Price is the main factor, but not the only factor. Because even  one species, different colors or purebred degrees will have a big deviation  in price. As long as its price is reasonable.  <br />Q: So price is still the main factor,  right?  <br />A: Yes.  <br />Q: In what areas do you hope the current  pet website can be improved?  <br />A: Many websites always push me a lot of  advertisements. I hate this. It also pushes me many related articles. But I  don't want to watch these. I just want to go up and see pets.     <br /><br />Summary: This user tends to browse pet  websites on the computer side. The frequency is three to four times a week.  The complicated functions and advertisements are useless for this user, and  may even affect the user experience. Price is his most important factor. |                                                         |
