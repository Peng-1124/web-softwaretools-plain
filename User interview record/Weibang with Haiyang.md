| Before the interview, we thanked the  interviewees for taking time out of their busy schedule to accept our interview.  The purpose of our interview is to get features from potential users that can  be added to our project. The interview lasted about 15 minutes. Here are the  records:  <br />W: As a  website showcasing pets, what do you feel are essential features?  <br />H: For example, if I want to find a  specific cat, I have to scroll down the list, which is not practical. And  then the sorting, nowadays, all the major software in the display of things  is not the choice of sorting, what distance first, price first and whatever. <br /> W: So these are some pretty basic  features you're talking about, are there any advanced ones? Something that  you think would make a difference?  <br />H: So do you perform any kinds of  function?  <br />W: Not really, we are using an API  written by someone else for this project, but it doesn't matter, you can  suggest what you think is a good idea first.  <br />H: I feel a bounty feature could be added.  <br />W: Oh? A novel idea, tell me more about  it?  <br />H: For example, if a person wants a  certain pet, they post a bounty board on the platform and then make their  offer and wait for the merchant to get in touch.  <br />W: So it means that both sellers and  vendors can post their trading needs on there and the platform tries its best  to facilitate these types of transactions, is that what you mean?  <br />H: Yes.  <br />W: Thank you for your reply, we will take  it into serious consideration.     <br /><br />Summary:  Haiyang considers it essential to have  some basic functions for the display board such as searching and filtering,  in addition to which a reward system could be added. |                                                         |
