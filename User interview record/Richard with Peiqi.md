| Before the interview, we thanked the  interviewees for taking time out of their busy schedule to accept our  interview. The purpose of our interview is to get features from potential  users that can be added to our project. The interview lasted about 10 minutes.  Here are the records:     <br />Q: Hello. I’m very glad that you can  accept my interview. Do you keep pets at home?  <br />A: Well, I sell cats.   <br />Q: Great. What features do you expect  from our website? As a seller. I also want you to give some advice as a  buyer.   <br />A: Well if I’m a buyer I will think your  website is perfect. As a seller I think your website is a little bit buyer-centered.   <br />Q: That is inevitable. The main users are  buyers.   <br />A: Yes, I know this. But you need to  understand that the website need to have enough resources, or sellers, to  attract buyers. If the seller’s user experience is not good, it will  eventually affect the entire project.   <br />Q: You are right. So what do you think  needs to be improved?   <br />A: As a seller I hope you can improve the  upload of pet information first. That’s a part of core functions.   <br />Q: Good. Anything else?  <br />A: It might be difficult, but I hope your  website can help sellers find potential and suitable customers.   <br />Q: We will consider this later.   <br />A: Very good. I think your website is good  overall.  <br />Q: Great. Thank you for your help.      <br /><br />Summary:  Peiqi Liu is one of potential seller we  will meet. She gave us her own insights as a seller on the design of the  website. In general, she affirmed our previous design, but believes that the  website should further improve the seller’s experience. Her insights are  really valuable. I think we will be inspired by it. |                                                         |
