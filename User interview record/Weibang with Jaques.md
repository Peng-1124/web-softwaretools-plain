| Before the interview, we thanked the  interviewees for taking time out of their busy schedule to accept our interview.  The purpose of our interview is to get features from potential users that can  be added to our project. The interview lasted about 15 minutes. Here are the  records:  <br />W:  We  are now going to make a website with a showcase page for a pet shop, as a potential  user, what do you think we need to pay attention to most?  <br />J:   The most important thing is to be able to  buy things properly on the website  <br />W:   This  is of course a necessary function, but I mean are there any other features  that you feel are necessary as a user.  <br />J:   That is the search function, and is to do  an order management system, you are selling pets on this site anyway, no  order system to say no. I don't want to look for cats in a pile of dogs, so  it’s better to build a classification system.  <br />W:   This  classification system, can I understand it as labeling?  <br />J:   Yes, yes, yes, it is possible to show  different kinds of animals separately anyway.  <br />W:   That's  a great idea, thanks for your input.     <br /><br />Summary:  Jaques considers the function of sorting  pets to be important and the possibility of implementing an order system. |                                                         |
