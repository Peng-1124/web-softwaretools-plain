| Before the interview, we thanked the  interviewees for taking time out of their busy schedule to accept our interview.  The purpose of our interview is to get features from potential users that can  be added to our project. The interview lasted about 15 minutes. Here are the  records:  <br />W: As a  website showcasing pets, what do you feel are essential features?  <br />J: Is the app already made now?  <br />W: Not yet, that's why I came to do an  interview with you.  <br />J: I think that many of the most popular  shopping apps are already very good, so why don't you try to emulate them?  <br />W: We're definitely going to look at  established products, so why don't you start with your ideas and what  features you think need to be implemented?  <br />J: That is the search function, then the  function to place an order, and also the collection function, for example, I  now see a cat that I like very much, but I have no idea to place an order for  the time being, I will collect it first and look at it later  <br />W: So are there any ideas for other  directions to think about?  <br />J: You can make an advertising image, the  kind that plays automatically  <br />W: Do you mean the rotating image?  <br />J: Yes.  W: This is indeed a great idea.     <br /><br />Summary:  Jenny feels that the order system and the  ad rotator are the more important features. |                                                         |
