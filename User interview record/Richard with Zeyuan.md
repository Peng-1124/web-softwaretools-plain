| Before the interview, we thanked the  interviewees for taking time out of their busy schedule to accept our  interview. The purpose of our interview is to get features from potential  users that can be added to our project. The interview lasted about 8 minutes.  Here are the records:     <br />Q: Hello. I’m very glad that you can  accept my interview. Do you keep pets at home?  <br />A: Yeah. I have a lovely cat.   <br />Q: Cool. What features do you expect from  our website? As a seller or a buyer.  <br />A: I think you have already done the core  functions. I just want to say that I want to be able to find the goods I want  easily. The search function is essential.   <br />Q: We will have that in out app. What  else do you want?   <br />A: I think the functions in your  questionnaire are very necessary. Oh, I hope your website can have screen  adaptation. People don’t always use the same device like PC to visit  websites. Mobile phones are also very important.  <br />Q: Great. All functions in the  questionnaire and screen adaptation, right?   <br />A: Yeah.   <br />Q: What features do you care most when  you are choosing a pet website?  <br />A: Reputation, I think. Yeah I know it’s irrelevant  to your topic but I have to say.   <br />Q: It's OK. Any other things about features?    <br />A: Nope. If you just want to know my  ideas about website features, I hope that your website can clearly display  products and make it easy for me to find them.  <br />Q: Good. Thank you for your help.      <br /><br />Summary:  Zeyuan Li is also a typical customer. He  also cares about the core functions of the website, but emphasizes the  ability to clearly view information and find products. I think this is not  only necessary for buyers. Page adaptation is an issue that needs to be  considered. |                                                         |
