| Content of interview items: What other  features do you think can be added to our website based on the basic  framework |                                                              |
| Before the interview, we thanked the  interviewees for taking time out of their busy schedule to accept our interview.  The purpose of our interview is to get features from potential users that can  be added to our project. The interview lasted about 15 minutes. Here are the  records:     <br />Q: What do you think is your most basic  requirement for using our website?  <br />A: I just want to buy my favorite pet. As  long as the function can help me quickly buy the pet I like, it is a good  function.  <br />Q: In page design, do you prefer to be  similar to Apple's website, or do you have multiple functions on one page for  you to choose?  <br />A: I think there should not be too many  functions and pictures in the page design. Because this will give me a sense  of chaos. Suppose I want to find a function I need, but there are dozens of  them on the page. I feel that this will make me irritable, and I don't want  to continue browsing at all.  <br />Q: What about the search function?  <br />A: The search function is a must. I  usually search directly for the items I want instead of looking at the  website to recommend me. I think there will be an advertising component in the  recommendation function, which is untrue.  <br />Q: Would you like to filter pets through  some filtering conditions? <br /> A: certainly. I think this is also the  most basic function. Such as prices or some special labels. This will save me  the time to choose.  <br />Q: Regarding order payment. Do you want  to contact the seller to pay offline or pay on the website? <br /> A: I think online payment may be more  secure. In this way, the money is retained on the platform first. Wait until  both parties are satisfied before transferring funds. This is more secure.  <br /><br />Summary: 1. The page design needs to be  as concise as possible. 2. The search function is indispensable. 3. To add  filtering function. |                                                              |
