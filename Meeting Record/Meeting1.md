#Meeting record on July 27th

We have a meeting on July 27th. 

The purpose of my meeting today is to assign roles and formulate tasks for the first iteration. One of our tasks is to customize the schedule of product development and another is to ask for user needs in various ways, that is, the needs of website users and owners. We will use different ways such as user questionnaire, user feedback, feedback from relevant personnel and analysis of websites with similar functions to get the requirement of this website(to help the owner to make his website more appealing).

Then we will make a timeline of our development. After get the requirement, we will design the website outlook, front-end framework, functions implemented on webiste.

If there is follow-up work, we will discuss it through daily meetings by Teams.
