If you want to sign in as an administrator, you should type "admin" as user name without password. And if you want to sign in as a user, you can click sign in directly without username and password. If you want to register, you can click register. The goal of login system is to Distinguish between administrator privileges and user privileges. Therefore, we only verify whether the user's account is "admin". We will explain it in our report.
