According to the charts above, we have discussed the results. As a seller,  there is a great demand for the first three features(1. The website can show the information of the pets to buyers. 2. Sellers can upload the images or tags of the pets in order to complete the information of pets which are selling. 3. Update the pets on sale information.), which may be because these three functions are the most basic for a sales website. Whether as a product manager or a user of a pet website, these features may be the most basic. In order to make the website selling pets work, these features above are indispensable in the eyes of users. As a buyer, viewing the photos, buying the favorite pets on website and checking the status of pets are the first three choices.

The main goal of first questionnaire is to get several basic features which can be added to our designing from the potential users. In this questionnaire survey, there are a small number of interns of product managers, so the survey population of this questionnaire is professional. Moreover, most of the respondents of this questionnaire are pet lovers or those who are interested in buying pets on the website, so this questionnaire is of great significance to us. It is of great significance to the functional design of our project. The first questionnaire collect some data related to basic features which can be added to our website.
